# [Day 10: Binary Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers)

#### Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

#### Task
Given a base-__*10*__ integer, __*n*__, convert it to binary (base-__*2*__). Then find and print the base-__*10*__ integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive __*1*__'s in __*n*__'s binary representation.

#### Input Format
A single integer, __*n*__.

#### Constraints
* __*1 <= n <= 10^6*__

#### Output Format
Print a single base-__*10*__ integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive __*1*__'s in the binary representation of __*n*__.

#### Sample Input 1
```
5
```

#### Sample Output 1
```
1
```

#### Sample Input 2
```
13
```

#### Sample Output 2
```
2
```

#### Explanation

###### Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of __*5*__ is __*101*__, so the maximum number of consecutive __*1*__'s is __*1*__.

###### Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of __*13*__ is __*1101*__, so the maximum number of consecutive __*1*__'s is __*2*__.
