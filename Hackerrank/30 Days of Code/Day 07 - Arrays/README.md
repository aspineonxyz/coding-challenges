# [Day 7: Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays)

#### Objective
Today, we're learning about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

#### Task
Given an array, __*A*__, of __*N*__ integers, print __*A*__'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

#### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, __*N*__ (the size of our array).
The second line contains __*N*__ space-separated integers describing array __*A*__'s elements.

#### Constraints
* __*1 <= N <= 1000*__
* __*1 <= A_i <= 10000*__, where __*A_i*__ is the __*i^th*__ integer in the array.

#### Output Format
Print the elements of array __*A*__ in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

#### Sample Input
```
4
1 4 3 2
```

#### Sample Output
