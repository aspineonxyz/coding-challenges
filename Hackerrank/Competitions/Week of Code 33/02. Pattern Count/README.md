<!-- # [Pattern Count](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w33/challenges/pattern-count)

A string __**__ contains many patterns of the form __**__ where __**__ represents any non-empty consecutive sequence of __**__'s. The patterns are allowed to overlap.

For example, consider string , we can see there are two consecutive sequences __**__ and __**__ which are of the form .

You have to answer __**__ queries, each containing a string __**__. For each query, find and print the total number of patterns of the form __**__ that occur in __**__.

#### Input Format
The first line contains a single integer , denoting the number of queries. After that, __**__ lines follow. The __**__ of them represents the __**__ test case and contains a string __**__ for this test case.

#### Constraints
* __**__
* __**__
* __**__ contains only digits and lowercase English letters

#### Output Format
Output exactly __**__ lines, one for each testcase.

#### Sample Input 0
```

1001010001
```

#### Sample Output 0

```

#### Explanation 0
* In the first case, __**__ we have __**__ as __**__ and __**__ as . Hence, we print __**__ as the answer.
* In the second case, __**__ we have __**__ as __**__ and __**__ as . Hence, we print __**__ as the answer.
* In the third case, __**__ we have __**__ as , __**__ as __**__ and __**__ as . Hence, we print __**__ as the answer. -->
