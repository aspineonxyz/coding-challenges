# Reverse a linked list

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. Change the `next` pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

#### Input Format
You have to complete the `Node* Reverse(Node* head)` method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

#### Output Format
Change the `next` pointers of the nodes that their order is reversed and `return` the head of the reversed linked list. Do __NOT__ print anything to stdout/console.

#### Sample Input
```
NULL
2 --> 3 --> NULL
```

#### Sample Output
```
NULL
3 --> 2 --> NULL
```

#### Explanation
1. Empty list remains empty
2. List is reversed from 2,3 to 3,2
