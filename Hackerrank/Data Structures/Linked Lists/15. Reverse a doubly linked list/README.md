# Reverse a doubly linked list

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a doubly linked list. Reverse the order of the nodes in the list. The head node might be NULL to indicate that the list is empty.

#### Input Format
You have to complete the `Node* Reverse(Node* head)` method which takes one argument - the head of the doubly linked list. You should __NOT__ read any input from stdin/console.

#### Output Format
Change the `next` and `prev` pointers of all the nodes so that the direction of the list is reversed. Then `return` the head node of the reversed list. Do __NOT__ print anything to stdout/console.

#### Sample Input
```
NULL
NULL <-- 2 <--> 4 <--> 6 --> NULL
```

#### Sample Output
```
NULL
NULL <-- 6 <--> 4 <--> 2 --> NULL
```

#### Explanation
1. Empty list, so nothing to do.
2. 2,4,6 become 6,4,2 o reversing in the given doubly linked list.
