# [Counting Valleys](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys)

Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike, he took exactly __*n*__ steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an *uphill* or a *downhill* step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level. We define the following terms:

* A *mountain* is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
* A *valley* is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.

Given Gary's sequence of *up* and *down* steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.

#### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, __*n*__, denoting the number of steps in Gary's hike.
The second line contains a single string of __*n*__ characters. Each character is __*Ïµ {U, D}*__ (where `U` indicates a step *up* and `D` indicates a step *down*), and the __*i^th*__ character in the string describes Gary's __*i^th*__ step during the hike.

#### Constraints
* __*2 <= N <= 10^6*__

#### Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the number of valleys Gary walked through during his hike.

#### Sample Input
```
8
UDDDUDUU
```

#### Sample Output
```
1
```

#### Explanation
If we represent __*_*__ as sea level, a step up as __*/*__, and a step down as __*\*__, Gary's hike can be drawn as:
```
_/\      _
   \    /
    \/\/
```

It's clear that there is only one valley there, so we print __*1*__ on a new line.
